                    Yes, my nickname translates as "dead" from russian. And yes, 50% of the reason to have such nickname is stupid jokes
                    as row above. The other 50% is I think about death with a smart face.

                    To be honest, i don't givashit what to add here more. While i was writing all this, I realised that all this
                    "owner" part is useless and I shouldn't have added it. I wonder... when i'll start adding content to other sections
                    I'll be thinking same way?

                    I am python (backend) dev, so you'll see bits of my python code in my blog posts. If you are intrested in python
                    (especially fastapi) you should definotely subscribe to my mailing list (when it will be implemented) and checkout
                    my github. Some of my "tooling" code for fastapi is there. While it has zero docs, you can still find bunch
                    of using examples in my other repos.
